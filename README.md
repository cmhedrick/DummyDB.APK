# DummyDB

#### What is DummyDB
A simple Android App to store info on various Persona Types and their name. The DB allows for additions and deletions. Also supports "Look Ups" to read data.

#### Purpose:
As part of the 100 Days of Code I wanted to develop an Android (or rather a mobile in general) application. Dispite being fluent in Java, I'm not a fan of it. So this led me to try multiple frameworks such as:
- Cordova (HTML5 & CSS3 & JS based framework)
- Kivy (Python & Cordova framework)
- Xamarin (C# framework)

I finally decided to use Xamarin because, I use the C# frequently. It was a very valuable experience to try the multiple frameworks but, Xamarin seemed to be the most refined.
#### Install:
1. Download the project either by ZIP or Cloning:
`git clone https://github.com/cmhedrick/DummyDB.APK.git`
2. change into the directory.
3. Double click the solution file (.sln). The solution should open in your C# instance.
